# What information does AlphaFold use from the Protein Data Bank?

AlphaFold is trained on protein chains in the PDB released before 2018-04-30. 
Predictions can also make use of up to 4 templates released before 2021-02-15. 
However, templates are not a critical input for AlphaFold to make an accurate prediction; 
the model can make a strong prediction based on a multiple sequence alignment alone. 





# How does AlphaFold compare to other structure prediction tools?

The CASP14 assessment compared leading structure prediction methods in detail; the results are available here. 
AlphaFold was the top-ranked method, with a median GDT (Global Distance Test) score of 92.4 across all targets 
and 87.0 on the challenging free-modelling category, compared to 72.8 and 61.0 for the next best methods in these categories.
Structural biologists more often express the similarity between two protein structures by first optimally 
superposing the structures and then calculating the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) between the Cα atoms 
of equivalent residues. Taking the median RMSD-Cα on the best predicted 95% of residues reduces the effect 
of flexible tails and crystal-packing artefacts. 
On this metric AlphaFold’s CASP14 predictions had a median distance of 0.96 Å to the experimental models, 
compared to 2.83 Å for the next-best method.






# Which proteins are included?

AlphaFold DB has grown in several stages:

    July 2021: included 20 model organism proteomes, with sequences taken from the “one sequence per gene” 
    reference proteomes provided in UniProt 2021_02.
    December 2021: added Swiss-Prot, from UniProt 2021_04.
    January 2022: added a collection of proteomes relevant to global health, taken from priority lists compiled 
    by the World Health Organisation. Sequences were again taken from the “one sequence per gene” 
    reference proteomes provided in UniProt 2021_04.
    July 2022: added most of the remaining UniProt 2021_04. As part of this release we have also included an 
    additional tar file on the AFDB download page and FTP, containing predictions in MANE select.
    Nov 2022: updated a set of structures affected by a temporary numerical bug (miscompilation) 
    in the previous July release (list of affected accessions, N.B. 160 MiB). 
    This temporary issue resulted in low accuracy predictions with correspondingly low pLDDT for ~4% of 
    the total structure predictions available in the database. This release includes:
    Updated coordinates for affected structures. You can still access all old coordinates as v3 files, and easily compare v3 and v4 coordinates
    Minor metadata changes in the mmCIF files for the rest of the structures (these files are released as v4). Please refer to our changelog for more details. 
    Note that as part of this release we’ve also removed predictions with Ca-Ca >10A.
The wider UniProt predictions are the output of a single model, while Swiss-Prot / proteomes entries represent the most confident prediction out of 5 model runs. 
Internal benchmarking on CASP14 shows that the model used for UniProt (“model_2_ptm”) is insignificantly less accurate (-1 GDT versus five models), 
and that there is a slight bias toward lower confidence (-1 pLDDT) due to the effect of using one model rather than selecting from 5.
Not all sequences are covered; the most common reasons for a missing sequence are:
    It is outside our length range. The minimum length is 16 amino acids, while the maximum is 2,700 for proteomes / Swiss-Prot and 1,280 for the rest of UniProt. For the human proteome only, 
    our download includes longer proteins segmented into fragments.
    It contains non-standard amino acids (e.g. X).
    It is not in the UniProt reference proteome “one sequence per gene” Fasta file.
    It has been added or modified by UniProt in a more recent release.
    It is a viral protein. These are currently excluded, pending improved support for polyproteins.

We plan to continue updating the database. In the meantime, if your sequence(s) aren’t included, 
you can generate your own AlphaFold predictions using DeepMind’s Colab notebook and open source code, 
which also support multimer predictions. 






# How many proteins are there in the database?

There are 214,683,839 structures available on the AlphaFold DB website, including 48 complete proteomes 
available for bulk download. An additional 3,095 structures are included in the human proteome download, 
covering sequences longer than our usual length limit split into fragments.







# What use cases does AlphaFold not support?

AlphaFold DB currently focuses on the use case validated in CASP14: predicting the structure of a single protein chain with a naturally occurring sequence. 
Many other use cases remain active areas of research, for example:

- The version of AlphaFold used to construct in this database does not output multi-chain predictions (complexes). 
  In some cases the single-chain prediction may correspond to the structure adopted in complex. 
  In other cases (especially where the chain is structured only on binding to partner molecules) 
  the missing context from surrounding molecules may lead to an uninformative prediction. 
  A separate version of AlphaFold was trained for complex prediction (AlphaFold Multimer). 
  You can find the open source code on GitHub and make multimer predictions using DeepMind’s Colab.
- For regions that are intrinsically disordered or unstructured in isolation AlphaFold is expected to produce a 
  low-confidence prediction (pLDDT < 50) and the predicted structure will have a ribbon-like appearance. 
  AlphaFold may be of use in identifying such regions, but the prediction makes no statement about the relative likelihood of 
  different conformations (it is not a sample from the Boltzmann distribution).
- AlphaFold has not been validated for predicting the effect of mutations. In particular, AlphaFold is not expected to produce an 
  unfolded protein structure given a sequence containing a destabilising point mutation.
- Where a protein is known to have multiple conformations, AlphaFold usually only produces one of them. 
  The output conformation cannot be reliably controlled.
- AlphaFold does not predict the positions of any non-protein components found in experimental structures 
  (such as cofactors, metals, ligands, ions, DNA/RNA, or post-translational modifications). 
  However, AlphaFold is trained to predict the structure of proteins as they might appear in the PDB. 
  Therefore backbone and side chain coordinates are frequently consistent with the expected structure 
  in the presence of ions (e.g. for zinc-binding sites) or cofactors (e.g. side chain geometry consistent with heme binding). 







# How can I download a structure prediction?

Coordinate files can be downloaded from the menu in the top right of the structure page in mmCIF or PDB format. 
These formats are widely accepted by 3D structure viewing software, such as PyMOL and Chimera.








Currently, there are around 230 million proteins in UniProt, with millions more catalogued every year. 
Each one has a unique 3D shape that determines how it works and what it does. AlphaFold DB now offers 
a prediction of what each of the over 200 millions known proteins in UniProt might look like. 







For decades, scientists have been trying to find a method to reliably predict a protein’s structure just from its sequence of amino acids.
This grand scientific challenge is known as the protein folding problem.
