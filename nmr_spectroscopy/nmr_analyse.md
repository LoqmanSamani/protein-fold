# Analyzing an NMR Spectrum

#### There are four main components of an NMR spectrum that should be identified and analyzed:

1. **Number of Signals:** Each peak represents a signal, and each signal is produced by a unique or chemically distinct hydrogen. In this case, there are three distinct peaks, each corresponding to a unique hydrogen.

2. **Splitting Pattern:** Determine the number of distinct splits in each signal.

3. **Integration:** Analyze the height of each signal.

4. **Chemical Shift:** Identify how far each signal is from the standard (TMS - Tetramethylsilane).

Here's a graphical representation for better understanding:

                                                                                  |
                         |                                                       ||    
                         ||                |                                     |||
                        ||||              ||                                     |||
                       ||||||             |||                                    |||                                 TMS
                  -----||||||------------|||||-----------------------------------|||-----------------------------------

         1) Signal: Each peack represents a signal (each signal produced by a unique or chimically dictinct hydrogen, 
                    in this case there is three distinct peacks each of which is reproduced by an unique hydrogen.)

         2) Splitting: The number of distinct splits in each signal

         3) Integration: How tall each signal is!

         4) Shifting: How far is a signal from standard(TMS)
