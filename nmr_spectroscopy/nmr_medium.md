### Introduction

In the 20th century, a variety of ***experimental techniques*** were used in an attempt to decipher the complicated three-dimensional structures of biological molecules. Among these, ***X-ray crystallography***, ***nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)***, and ***electron microscopy*** stood out as pioneers in revolutionizing ***structural biology***. The discovery and application of ***X-rays*** to ***protein crystals*** marked a transformative era, enabling scientists to unveil the atomic details of biological molecules.

With the progress of these techniques, ***structural biology*** developed into an independent discipline that is intertwined with molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysics and is dedicated to deciphering the molecular architecture of biological macromolecules.

This article deals with the advantages of NMR spectroscopy and its central role in the elucidation of the ***three-dimensional structures of proteins***. NMR spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool that captivates biologists working in structural biology, providing unparalleled insights into the dynamics, interactions and structures of biological macromolecules at the atomic level. Beyond pure structural elucidation, NMR spectroscopy is proving invaluable in the study of molecular interactions by revealing crucial details about binding interfaces, kinetics and thermodynamics.

In particular, NMR plays a central role in the study of ***intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)***, a category that cannot be crystallized. The versatility of NMR spans various biological fields and demonstrates its capabilities in unraveling the mysteries of protein dynamics that are crucial for understanding their biological functions.


### Advances in NMR Spectroscopy

The inception of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, approximately 80 years ago at the conclusion of World War II, marked a transformative moment in scientific exploration. Independently discovered by two distinguished groups led by Felix Bloch et al. and Edward Purcell et al., NMR's evolution has been punctuated by key milestones and innovations.

In the early years following its discovery, NMR found its way into the realm of chemistry when W.G. Proctor and F.C. Yu stumbled upon a serendipitous observation—distinct signals from the two nitrogens in NH4NO3. This marked the pioneering recognition of the ***chemical shift*** phenomenon, a cornerstone in NMR spectroscopy.

The narrative advanced with the detection of spin-spin interactions, known as the ***nuclear Overhauser effect***, by Overhauser in 1953. This breakthrough revelation showcased the communication between spins, observed during the saturation of electrons in metals.

Initially constrained by limited sensitivity, NMR faced a pivotal turning point with the advent of stronger electromagnetic fields. Superconducting magnets, introduced in the early 1960s, propelled NMR frequencies to 100 MHz for the 1H nucleus. Overcoming technical challenges related to ***magnet homogeneity*** and stability, the first 200 MHz spectrum of ethanol was triumphantly published in 1964.

A quantum leap in sensitivity followed with the introduction of ***Fourier-transformed (FT) NMR*** in 1966 by Ernst and Anderson. This methodological breakthrough allowed the simultaneous excitation and subsequent unravelling of all signals, paving the way for the development of myriad pulse sequences.

The journey into structural biology commenced in the 1960s with studies on small biological molecules like common amino acids. Synthetic and natural peptides, as well as paramagnetic proteins such as cytochrome c and myoglobin, dominated research endeavors during this period.

A pivotal moment arrived in 1976 with the introduction of ***two-dimensional (2D) NMR*** by R. Ernst et al., building upon the insightful idea of J. Jeener, a Belgian physicist.

The landscape shifted in 1985 with the publication of the first structure of a small ***globular protein***. Despite initial skepticism from the X-ray crystallography community, this marked the advent of three-dimensional (3D) NMR. This technique initially unfolded on unlabeled proteins in 1990, swiftly followed by a suite of triple resonance experiments using 15N and 13C labeled samples.

Today, NMR stands as a unique and versatile technique, offering a plethora of multidimensional experiments.
