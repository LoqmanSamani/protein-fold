### Introduction

In the 20th century, a variety of ***experimental techniques*** were used in an attempt to decipher the complicated three-dimensional structures of biological molecules. Among these, ***X-ray crystallography***, ***nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)***, and ***electron microscopy*** stood out as pioneers in revolutionizing ***structural biology***. The discovery and application of ***X-rays*** to ***protein crystals*** marked a transformative era, enabling scientists to unveil the atomic details of biological molecules.
With the progress of these techniques, ***structural biology*** developed into an independent discipline that is intertwined with molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysics and is dedicated to deciphering the molecular architecture of biological macromolecules.
This article deals with the advantages of NMR spectroscopy and its central role in the elucidation of the ***three-dimensional structures of proteins***. NMR spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool that captivates biologists working in structural biology, providing unparalleled insights into the dynamics, interactions and structures of biological macromolecules at the atomic level. Beyond pure structural elucidation, NMR spectroscopy is proving invaluable in the study of molecular interactions by revealing crucial details about binding interfaces, kinetics and thermodynamics.
In particular, NMR plays a central role in the study of ***intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)***, a category that cannot be crystallized. The versatility of NMR spans various biological fields and demonstrates its capabilities in unraveling the mysteries of protein dynamics that are crucial for understanding their biological functions.
