##  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy In Biology


**The process of resonance assignment:** This step of NMR is compared with a jigsaw puzzle

If the 3D-Structure of protein is already known, NMR can be used to study the interactions between molecules, providing information about binding interfaces, kinetics, and thermodynamics.

NMR can also be employed to monitor the dynamic movements of proteins, which are critical for their biological function.

### NMR Evolution

-  NMR was independently discovered by two groups led by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell at the end of World War II.

### 2D NMR

In the early days of NMR, 2D NMR was introduced for studying biomolecules by K. Wüthrich's group. They demonstrated its feasibility using a 10 mM sample of BPTI, a 58 amino acid protein, despite limited computational resources at the time. However, high protein concentrations were initially required, which limited its practical use. Over the years, technical improvements reduced this constraint.

### Usage

Biological NMR has evolved to encompass various applications beyond protein structure determination. While the number of NMR-solved structures has not grown as rapidly as those solved by X-ray crystallography, NMR offers unique advantages. It can investigate the dynamics of molecules over a wide range of time scales, making it useful for studying slow and fast molecular motions. In drug discovery, NMR is valuable for mapping chemical shifts to understand how proteins interact with ligands, making it a powerful tool for screening and optimizing potential drug candidates. 



1. NMR Parameters and Nuclei: NMR spectroscopy is used to study nuclei with a net spin, and hydrogen (1H) is particularly well-suited for NMR because it has a spin of 1/2. In contrast, carbon (12C), nitrogen (14N), and oxygen (16O) are not easily visible using NMR due to their isotopes. However, it's possible to enhance NMR sensitivity for these nuclei by "isotope-labeling" with isotopes like 13C and 15N, which has become more cost-effective over time.

2. Magnetic Field and Anisotropic Interactions: NMR experiments are conducted in a strong static magnetic field (B0), typically several Tesla, aligned along the +z axis. This magnetic field makes the environment non-isotropic, and all interactions experienced by the nuclear spins depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to this magnetic field. Mathematically, these anisotropic NMR interactions are described by second-rank tensors or 3x3 matrices.

3. Liquid-State NMR: In liquid-state NMR, the molecule being studied is freely rotating with a correlation time (τc) typically ranging from 1 to 50 nanoseconds. This time is much smaller than the acquisition time for NMR data. When the rotation is isotropic, all interactions average out, and only the isotropic component of the interactions is observed. This property is why solution NMR spectra often display sharp resonances compared to solid-state NMR spectra, where the molecules are less mobile and the interactions are less averaged out.
