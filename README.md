If you are a student or researcher in any subfield of biology, you have undoubtedly heard about protein structure and how crucial it is to understand the intricacies of these biomolecules. The structure, particularly the tertiary or quaternary structure, of a polypeptide or protein, especially enzymes, is one of the most critical aspects of each protein. For instance, in enzymes, the binding of substrates to the active site is highly dependent on the enzyme's three-dimensional active site structure. Therefore, the study of protein structure is an essential subject in molecular biology, and this information finds applications in various medical and biological domains, including drug design and discovery, pharmacology, synthetic biology, and the food industry.


Within this repository, I aim to share my exploration of various methodologies, both experimental and computational, employed in the field of biology to unravel these intricate protein structures. The goal is to provide a comparative analysis, 
shedding light on the diverse approaches utilized in understanding the complexities of protein architecture.
